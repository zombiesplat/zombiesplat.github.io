Welcome to Asterisk Pound!


Question #1: Where does the name come from?  
Answer: A cartoon depiction of a four-letter curse word **`*#!~`**


I came up with the concept and logo before realizing the complexity of making a domain name from this concept. I created
Asterisk Pound out of necessity as I found myself serving small businesses of Arizona as a network administrator and all
around computer guy. However after I found that my "side" business of writing and fixing PHP websites was earning far
more money than fixing computers, I quickly changed my focus. After all, I studied computer science and was hardly using
that education.
